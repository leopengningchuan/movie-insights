Exploring movie data with Python â€” from insights to recommendations

## Project Background
In the film industry, making sense of large volumes of movie data is key to understanding what drives audience interest and box office success. With thousands of movies spanning decades, structured analysis can uncover hidden patterns and improve decision-making for studios, streaming platforms, and viewers alike.

This project leverages [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data?status=pending&select=movies_metadata.csv) from Kaggle to explore the landscape of film production and reception through data-driven methods. It combines exploratory analysis with several recommendation systems to uncover trends and generate personalized movie suggestions, highlighting the practical value of data science in the creative industry.
